## Working on specification

### Install

2. Install [dotnet cli](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
3. Clone repo and inside the repo directory
   - Run `npm install`

### Usage

1. Run `npm run start`
2. Check console output to see where local server is started
3. Make changes using your favorite editor (or the `swagger-editor` shipped with the project - look for the URL in the console output)
4. All changes are immediately propagated to your local server, moreover all documentation pages will be automagically refreshed in a browser after each change
   **TIP:** you can open `swagger-editor`, documentation and `swagger-ui` in parallel
5. Once you finish with the changes you can run tests using: `npm run test`
